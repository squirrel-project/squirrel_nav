### mlpack ?.?.?
###### ????-??-??
  * Bugfix for mlpack_knn program (#816).

### mlpack 2.1.1
###### 2016-12-22
  * HMMs now use random initialization; this should fix some convergence issues
    (#828).

  * HMMs now initialize emissions according to the distribution of observations
    (#833).

  * Minor fix for formatted output (#814).

  * Fix DecisionStump to properly work with any input type.

### mlpack 2.1.0
###### 2016-10-31
  * Fixed CoverTree to properly handle single-point datasets.

  * Fixed a bug in CosineTree (and thus QUIC-SVD) that caused split failures for
    some datasets (#717).

  * Added mlpack_preprocess_describe program, which can be used to print
    statistics on a given dataset (#742).

  * Fix prioritized recursion for k-furthest-neighbor search (mlpack_kfn and the
    KFN class), leading to orders-of-magnitude speedups in some cases.

  * Bump minimum required version of Armadillo to 4.200.0.

  * Added simple Gradient Descent optimizer, found in
    src/mlpack/core/optimizers/gradient_descent/ (#792).

  * Added approximate furthest neighbor search algorithms QDAFN and
    DrusillaSelect in src/mlpack/methods/approx_kfn/, with command-line program
    mlpack_approx_kfn.

### mlpack 2.0.3
###### 2016-07-21
  * Added multiprobe LSH (#691).  The parameter 'T' to LSHSearch::Search() can
    now be used to control the number of extra bins that are probed, as can the
    -T (--num_probes) option to mlpack_lsh.

  * Added the Hilbert R tree to src/mlpack/core/tree/rectangle_tree/ (#664).  It
    can be used as the typedef HilbertRTree, and it is now an option in the
    mlpack_knn, mlpack_kfn, mlpack_range_search, and mlpack_krann command-line
    programs.

  * Added the mlpack_preprocess_split and mlpack_preprocess_binarize programs,
    which can be used for preprocessing code (#650, #666).

  * Added OpenMP support to LSHSearch and mlpack_lsh (#700).

### mlpack 2.0.2
###### 2016-06-20
  * Added the function LSHSearch::Projections(), which returns an arma::cube
    with each projection table in a slice (#663).  Instead of Projection(i), you
    should now use Projections().slice(i).

  * A new constructor has been added to LSHSearch that creates objects using
    projection tables provided in an arma::cube (#663).

  * Handle zero-variance dimensions in DET (#515).

  * Add MiniBatchSGD optimizer (src/mlpack/core/optimizers/minibatch_sgd/) and
    allow its use in mlpack_logistic_regression and mlpack_nca programs.

  * Add better backtrace support from Grzegorz Krajewski for Log::Fatal messages
    when compiled with debugging and profiling symbols.  This requires libbfd
    and libdl to be present during compilation.

  * CosineTree test fix from Mikhail Lozhnikov (#358).

  * Fixed HMM initial state estimation (#600).

  * Changed versioning macros __MLPACK_VERSION_MAJOR, __MLPACK_VERSION_MINOR,
    and __MLPACK_VERSION_PATCH to MLPACK_VERSION_MAJOR, MLPACK_VERSION_MINOR,
    and MLPACK_VERSION_PATCH.  The old names will remain in place until
    mlpack 3.0.0.

  * Renamed mlpack_allknn, mlpack_allkfn, and mlpack_allkrann to mlpack_knn,
    mlpack_kfn, and mlpack_krann.  The mlpack_allknn, mlpack_allkfn, and
    mlpack_allkrann programs will remain as copies until mlpack 3.0.0.

  * Add --random_initialization option to mlpack_hmm_train, for use when no
    labels are provided.

  * Add --kill_empty_clusters option to mlpack_kmeans and KillEmptyClusters
    policy for the KMeans class (#595, #596).

### mlpack 2.0.1
###### 2016-02-04
  * Fix CMake to properly detect when MKL is being used with Armadillo.

  * Minor parameter handling fixes to mlpack_logistic_regression (#504, #505).

  * Properly install arma_config.hpp.

  * Memory handling fixes for Hoeffding tree code.

  * Add functions that allow changing training-time parameters to HoeffdingTree
    class.

  * Fix infinite loop in sparse coding test.

  * Documentation spelling fixes (#501).

  * Properly handle covariances for Gaussians with large condition number
    (#496), preventing GMMs from filling with NaNs during training (and also
    HMMs that use GMMs).

  * CMake fixes for finding LAPACK and BLAS as Armadillo dependencies when ATLAS
    is used.

  * CMake fix for projects using mlpack's CMake configuration from elsewhere
    (#512).

### mlpack 2.0.0
###### 2015-12-24
  * Removed overclustering support from k-means because it is not well-tested,
    may be buggy, and is (I think) unused.  If this was support you were using,
    open a bug or get in touch with us; it would not be hard for us to
    reimplement it.

  * Refactored KMeans to allow different types of Lloyd iterations.

  * Added implementations of k-means: Elkan's algorithm, Hamerly's algorithm,
    Pelleg-Moore's algorithm, and the DTNN (dual-tree nearest neighbor)
    algorithm.

  * Significant acceleration of LRSDP via the use of accu(a % b) instead of
    trace(a * b).

  * Added MatrixCompletion class (matrix_completion), which performs nuclear
    norm minimization to fill unknown values of an input matrix.

  * No more dependence on Boost.Random; now we use C++11 STL random support.

  * Add softmax regression, contributed by Siddharth Agrawal and QiaoAn Chen.

  * Changed NeighborSearch, RangeSearch, FastMKS, LSH, and RASearch API; these
    classes now take the query sets in the Search() method, instead of in the
    constructor.

  * Use OpenMP, if available.  For now OpenMP support is only available in the
    DET training code.

  * Add support for predicting new test point values to LARS and the
    command-line 'lars' program.

  * Add serialization support for Perceptron and LogisticRegression.

  * Refactor SoftmaxRegression to predict into an arma::Row<size_t> object, and
    add a softmax_regression program.

  * Refactor LSH to allow loading and saving of models.

  * ToString() is removed entirely (#487).

  * Add --input_model_file and --output_model_file options to appropriate
    machine learning algorithms.

  * Rename all executables to start with an "mlpack" prefix (#229).

  * Add HoeffdingTree and mlpack_hoeffding_tree, an implementation of the
    streaming decision tree methodology from Domingos and Hulten in 2000.

### mlpack 1.0.12
###### 2015-01-07
  * Switch to 3-clause BSD license (from LGPL).

  * Proper handling of dimension calculation in PCA.

  * Load parameter vectors properly for LinearRegression models.

  * Linker fixes for AugLagrangian specializations under Visual Studio.

  * Add support for observation weights to LinearRegression.

  * Fixes for numerous intermittent test failures.

  * math::RandomSeed() now sets the random seed for recent (>=3.930) Armadillo
    versions.

  * Handle Newton method convergence better for
    SparseCoding::OptimizeDictionary() and make maximum iterations a parameter.

  * Known bug: CosineTree construction may fail in some cases on i386 systems
    (#358).

### mlpack 1.0.10
###### 2014-08-29
  * Bugfix for NeighborSearch regression which caused very slow allknn/allkfn.
    Speeds are now restored to approximately 1.0.8 speeds, with significant
    improvement for the cover tree (#347).

  * Detect dependencies correctly when ARMA_USE_WRAPPER is not being defined
    (i.e., libarmadillo.so does not exist).

  * Bugfix for compilation under Visual Studio (#348).

### mlpack 1.0.9
###### 2014-07-28

    not one-indexed (#311).

  * CF::GetRecommendations() API change: now requires the number of
    recommendations as the first parameter.  The number of users in the local
    neighborhood should be specified with CF::NumUsersForSimilarity().

  * Removed incorrect PeriodicHRectBound (#58).

  * Refactor LRSDP into LRSDP class and standalone function to be optimized
    (#305).

  * Fix for centering in kernel PCA (#337).

  * Added Nyström method for kernel matrix approximation by Marcus Edel.

  * Kernel PCA now supports using Nyström method for approximation.

  * Ball trees now work with dual-tree algorithms, via the BallBound<> bound
    structure (#307); fixed by Yash Vadalia.

  * The NMF class is now AMF<>, and supports far more types of factorizations,
    by Sumedh Ghaisas.

  * A QUIC-SVD implementation has returned, written by Siddharth Agrawal and
    based on older code from Mudit Gupta.

  * Added perceptron and decision stump by Udit Saxena (these are weak learners
    for an eventual AdaBoost class).

  * Sparse autoencoder added by Siddharth Agrawal.
