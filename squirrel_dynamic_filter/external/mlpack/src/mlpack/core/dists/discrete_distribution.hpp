 * A discrete distribution where the only observations are discrete
 * observations.  This is useful (for example) with discrete Hidden Markov
 * Models, where observations are non-negative integers representing specific
 * emissions.
 *
 * No bounds checking is performed for observations, so if an invalid
 * observation is passed (i.e. observation > numObservations), a crash will
 * probably occur.
 *
 * This distribution only supports one-dimensional observations, so when passing
 * an arma::vec as an observation, it should only have one dimension
 * (vec.n_rows == 1).  Any additional dimensions will simply be ignored.
 *
 * @note
 * This class, like every other class in mlpack, uses arma::vec to represent
 * observations.  While a discrete distribution only has positive integers
 * (size_t) as observations, these can be converted to doubles (which is what
 * arma::vec holds).  This distribution internally converts those doubles back
 * into size_t before comparisons.
